# Melissa Wagasky - M1 Portfolio

# Areas of Emphasis

My focus this module was to learn best practices for writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery so that I could carry those basics with me through the rest of my learning as I robust technical skillset. I wanted to learn how to program with others in a collaborative setting and I wanted to build a strong foundation that will serve me as I learn more complicated technologies, frameworks, and languages. I feel like I have learned solid foundational skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery and am excited for the next phase of learning.

# A: End of Module Assessment

# B: Individual Work & Projects

I completed three static comps and one javascript app this module as an individual. 

## Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wagasky/mw-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

This static comp recreated a dynamic, fluid grid layout. I used CSS and HTML to recreate the comp and I employed flexbox to implement responsivity in the design. 

Reviewer: Louisa

Things that went well:
* Responsive implementation and flexbox
* Typography control at different media widths
* Color palette, font, and logo choices

Things to improve and refactor:

Improvements to color choices - blue and gold don't have enough contrast and can make boundary less visible to the user.
* Add icon to the button
* One media query break point in grad layout (Pam helped me to refactor)
* Need to open up the line heights to prevent text overlap and be mindful of typography

I'd like to implement this feedback and implement hover and active states on all the buttons. I'd 

## Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wagasky/mw-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

In this static comp, I implemented a card layout using CSS grid, CSS flex-box, and HTML. I also utilized a normalize file and did some minor cross-browser testing.

Reviewer - Louisa:

Things that went well:
* Card control, inner-card styling and grouping, and responsive movement of cards at different media widths.
* Color choices

Things to improve and refactor:
* On cards - soften the drop shadow, put in hover states and live links
* Improve spacing between cards and keep cards as a group when cards are 3 across - (law of proximity/Gestaldt)
* Nav - right align login, make the nav bar smaller and possibly just use NP arrowhead, 
* Add margin on the bottom below cards and evenly space the grid gutters between cards

Next steps:
* I want to implement these changes and continue working on the sticky nav to include a drawer and mobile navigation menu.

## Static Comp 3

* [GitHub URL](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

In this comp, I implemented a dashboard with multiple navigation elements, data visulatization, and lots of content. I used a combination of CSS grid and CSS flex-box to achieve the layout and the responsive design.

Reviewer - David:

Things that went well:
* Overall layout, responsiveness, mobile view, and ipad view choices

Things to improve and refactor:
* Improve the use of white space, especially when there was too much, by bumping up fonts
* Improve resume layout, left align all elements, ensure paragraph text extends the right of the resume
* Improve edit button and open button icon/text relationship
* Bump up text size in the nav drawer
* Improve spacing on social media button layouts to match comp
* Refactor code as I go, 'tree-shaking' my css and improving nested-element indentation on HTML

Next steps:

* I want to implement these changes and finish inserting content for my theme. I'd also love to animate the graphs and implement a bar graph with CSS/the D3 javascript library.

## Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wagasky/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

A game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.

#### Evaluator: David Whitaker
#### Notes/What To Work On:

* Work on syntax, indentation, and using more semantic tags consistently

#### Scores:
* Functional Expectations - Proficient: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.  
* COMP RECREATION / DESIGN - Advanced Beginner  
* HTML - Advanced Beginner  
* CSS - Advanced Beginner
* JS/jQuery - Advanced Beginner 

# C: Group Work & Projects

## Projects

I had three paired project this mod and was lucky to have a really great partnership in all three. I learned a lot from my partners and am grateful for all of their hard work, energy, and friendship.

## Linked List

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment]()

In Linked List, James and I built a JavaScript and jQuery app that saves a users links to favorite websites. Our user could save links, delete them, or mark them as read.

#### Partner: James
#### Evaluator: Louisa
#### Notes/What To Work On:

* great job coordinating
* great details, really nice UI additions
* not totally responsive, layout breaks at 320
* fix the little ribbon with the counter on stacked layout -- really nice UI choice, just make sure that its tight!
* massive eventListener -- refactor to small, single responsibility functions that can be called on click

#### Scores:

Functional Expectations - Proficient: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three. Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.
COMP RECREATION / DESIGN - Proficient (because of not being totally responsive)
HTML - Proficient  
CSS - Proficient  
JS/jQuery - Advanced Beginner, Proficient  
GIT & GITHUB - Proficient  
Pairing/Collaboration - Proficient, Exceptional  
Surprise and Delight - Hot Fire

## IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wagasky/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

In IdeaBox, Amanda and I built an app that helps a user save their ideas to a list and note the quality of the idea. We used jQuery and JSON to implement local storage so that a user's idea would persist. 

##### Partner: Amanda
##### Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
##### Notes/What To Work On:

* Majority of functionality met! No error handling - can create blank cards with no title and/or body.
* Good naming and convetions followed for Git/Github. And YAY for using Waffle to stay on top of issues!
* Design stays very true to comp
* Good organization of CSS file
* Remove unnecessary spacing in HTML file. Hooray for ARIA - continue to push forward. Add lang attribute to HTML
* Areas for refactoring: event listeners to reference named functions instead of anonymous functions. Change for loop in lines 123 and 190 to array prototypes. Some redundancy between editCardTitle and EditCardDescription that could be refactored. Unclear why quality is set up as a parameter in your constructor as it's never passed in as an argument.

## ToDoBox Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wagasky/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

In ToDoBox, Alex and I took an existing code base, refactored it to have complete IdeaBox functionality, and pivoted the app to be a todo list for our user. We learned a lot about refactoring and what it looks like to inherit code like we will be doing in our future roles.

### Partner - Alex
### Evaluator: David
### Notes/What To Work On:

* nice work on colors and active states for filtering
* Not through crossing things out

##### comp
* could have bigger title and empty state messages

##### html
* looked great, weird to have numerical ids

##### css
* borderline exceptional

##### js
* nice job organizing - you set a criteria and spoke to it
* creating an object from an object is weird
* naming conventions could use work
* decoupling data from markup

##### git/github
* could work on more commits and more verbose commits
* take the extra time to get into a habit

# D: Professional Skills
This mod I participated in a variety of gear up sessions. I really enjoy these and am grateful they are part of our curriculum here. They facilitated some of the most interesting and meaningful conversations I've had so far at Turing.

#Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

This was a great session about maintaining a growth mindset and focusing on 'yet'. When things have been hard, I have focused on what I am learning and that I just don't know something yet. This growth mindset has helped me with my most challenging moments at Turing.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

This was one of my favorite lessons this mod. Will did an incredible job facilitating our conversation and I learned so much from the videos and things that were chosen for the lesson. I've carried these lessons about cognitive load through the mod and will probably do so forever.

#### Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

I am an extroverted ambivert. I loved getting to know what my different classmates working styles were. Being able to see the introverts, extroverts and ambiverts as we walked around the round was really helpful. I was able to take the feedback during the session and have a better understanding of what a partner or classmate might need in a specific situation.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

The video and the conversation we had in the session was incredible. Ellen-mary facilitated a really meaningful discussion and in general exudes wisdom onto all of us. I was proud of how much my classmates shared and of the honest conversations we had about some of the gender dynamics we have in class and the real world. I'm so proud of our diverse cohort and I feel really really lucky to be surrounded by so many incredible women.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I really love the Turing community and felt happy to be part of what I could this module. I paired every week with someone from mod 2 (and on a few given weeks EVERY DAY). I tried to attend everything I could and came to every optional speaker session and several lunch time events. I have started going to JCS and to Iron FE. I have also tried to work hard to make sure our cohort is a place where everyone feels welcome and belongs. I'm so proud of the bond our cohort has and how everyone is invested in each other's success and learning. 

I hope to get more involved next mod. I loved the gearup about Social Movement in Tech and it has me really fired up about organizing a hackathon at Turing. I'm excited to give back to the next mod 1 by pairing and helping with mythical creatures the way this Mod 2 helped us. And I'm excited to continue to build relationship across the school.
