## Areas of Emphasis

*“The key to realizing a dream is to focus not on success but on significance — and then even the small steps and little victories along your path will take on greater meaning.”*
― Oprah Winfrey

This module I hoped to build on my knowledge of Javascript and API calls, and learn how to deliver seamless user experiences and client side applications
with more complex api calls and interactions. I wanted to work hard to build a strong foundation with React, Redux, and Javascript testing. I also wanted 
to push myself to write more declarative Javascript and concise code. Finally after feeling strong in Redux/React, I wanted to push myself with a personal project that meant a lot to me.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### SwapiBox

*“Challenges are gifts that force us to search for a new center of gravity. Don’t fight them. Just find a new way to stand.”*
― Oprah Winfrey

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wagasky/SWapiBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

Swapibox was a project the cemented my understanding of React and Component LifeCycleMethods. We made asynchronous api calls to the StarWars API and rendered data to the dom.

* Completion: 4

#### readToMe - personal project

*"Think like a queen. A queen is not afraid to fail. Failure is another stepping stone to greatness."*
-Oprah, duh

User problem: Being a proficient reader by the 3rd grade is important milestone for students. 3rd grade is the time when students transition from learning to read  - to reading to learn. For students from low-income communities often don’t have access to enough books at home to spend the time with books that they need to become readers. The Obama administration started an initiative to access the publishing rights to open thousands of books to be free and open for students in Title 1 schools (low-income communities). With the administration change, the project has stalled out and I wanted to contribute if I could. Right now there is an app that has titles. Also students in younger grades who are just learning to read don’t just need titles, they need help with reading and to get regular feedback on their reading to become strong readers.

Solution: ReadToMe is an app the contains a bookshelf for young readers and allows them to get feedback about how they are reading aloud. Readers can select a book and read. They can also record themselves reading and get feedback about how accurate their reading matched the selected text. ReadToMe is a javascript application built with React, Redux and Router and utizlizes the Watson Natural Language Api for transcription. I also built a node.js express server and websocket for real-time audio streaming.

-Lil Wayne


### Gear Up

#### Microagressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_update.md)

This was a session I did a makeup for. Understanding microagressions - both when we experience them and when we inflict them. I think the framework presented a great path forward for addressing microaggressions. It's more effective to address a microaggression in the moment as an ally and important lens of responsibility to move forward with.

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

This was a great session full of hard conversations. It reminded me that it's important to have a conversation about bias in every new group and to establish norms about our goals around biases - before they come up in hiring, etc.

#### Relaxation

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1801-inning/group_3.md)

In this session we talked about techniques for relaxation during stressful situations.

## E: Community Participation - aka Family time

### Playing a Part

* Played a leadership role in Joan Clarke
* Played a leadership role in Iron-FE
* Coaching and mentorship
* Representing Turing at the EthDenver Hackathon
* Dishes

**Joan Clarke** - this inning I led the kickoff session for Joan Clarke and reached out to students in lower mods to lead specific sessions.

**Iron FE** - I led multiple Iron-FE sessions and supported other women in leading/teaching their first sessions as well to encourage more female leadership and participation in the sessions. Our female led sessions had the highest participation of the inning and saw many students who don't normally attend IronFE.

**Coaching and Mentorship** - I mentor and coach several of my younger classmates and students in lower mods - from helping them with cold outreach, resumes to helping them with their projects to helping them with conflict resolution and communication. 

**EthDenver** - I participated in the EthDenver hackathon during week 4 and built the front end for a liquid democracy voting application in React/Redux/Router. It was great practice for the final - we spun up our app in 16 hours - and we won a bounty of $500 in ether and have a contract to continue the work for more if we choose. It was a great chance to represent Turing and to be one of a handful of women at the giant conference.

**Dishes** - I think this one is self-explanatory. I'm grown.
